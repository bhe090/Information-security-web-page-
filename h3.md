### Overview:

 90% of applications tested for misconfiguration, with average incidence rate of 4%.

Notable Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) occurrences: CWE-16 and CWE-611.

Highly configurable software contributes to misconfiguration risks.

### Description of Vulnerabilities:

Missing security hardening and improper permissions.

Enabling unnecessary features or default accounts/passwords.

Revealing sensitive error messages.

Disabling security features in upgrades or using outdated software.

Insecure settings in application servers, frameworks, etc.

Absence of security headers or outdated software.

### Prevention Measures:

Implement secure installation processes.

Automate repeatable hardening processes.

Use minimal platform, remove unused features.

Regularly review and update configurations.

Implement segmented application architecture.

Send security directives to clients.

Automate verification of configurations.

### Example Attack Scenarios:

Sample applications with known flaws left on production servers.

Directory listing enables access to sensitive files.

Detailed error messages expose vulnerabilities.

Default sharing permissions in cloud storage expose data.

### List of Mapped CWEs:

Includes CWEs related to environment, misconfigurations in ASP.NET, exposure of sensitive information, improper restriction of XML external entity reference, and more.

### How to prevent
Implement secure installation processes:

Automate a repeatable hardening process for deploying environments with consistent configurations across development, QA, and production.
Utilize different credentials for each environment.
Use a minimal platform:

Avoid unnecessary features, components, documentation, and samples.
Remove or abstain from installing unused features and frameworks.
Review and update configurations regularly:

Stay vigilant for security notes, updates, and patches.
Conduct thorough reviews of cloud storage permissions, such as S3 bucket permissions.
Implement a segmented application architecture:

Employ segmentation, containerization, or cloud security groups (ACLs) to separate components or tenants effectively and securely.
Send security directives to clients:

Utilize security headers to enforce security policies and best practices on client systems.
Automate verification of configurations:

Implement automated processes to regularly verify the effectiveness of configurations and settings across all environments.
Example Attack Scenarios and Prevention:

Scenario #1:

Remove sample applications from production servers to prevent known security flaws exploitation.
Ensure default account passwords are changed.
Regularly audit and remove unnecessary features to minimize attack surface.
Scenario #2:

Disable directory listing on servers to prevent unauthorized access.
Encrypt sensitive files and data to protect against unauthorized retrieval.
Scenario #3:

Configure application servers to return generic error messages instead of detailed stack traces.
Keep software up-to-date with security patches to address known vulnerabilities.
Scenario #4:

## A06:2021 – Vulnerable and Outdated Components

Ranked #2 in the Top 10 community survey and data-driven ranking.

Vulnerable Components category lacks mapped CVEs and uses default exploits/impact weight.

Notable CWEs include CWE-1104: Use of Unmaintained Third-Party Components.

#### Description of Vulnerabilities:

Vulnerable if unaware of component versions used.

Risk from vulnerable, unsupported, or outdated software components.

Lack of regular vulnerability scanning and subscription to security bulletins.

Delayed or infrequent patching exposes organizations to fixed vulnerabilities.

Lack of compatibility testing for updated libraries and components.

Failure to secure component configurations.

#### How to Prevent:

Implement a patch management process to remove unused dependencies and features.

Continuously inventory component versions and monitor for vulnerabilities using tools like OWASP Dependency Check and retire.js.

Obtain components from official sources via secure links and prefer signed packages.
 
Monitor and address unmaintained or unpatched components, considering virtual patches if necessary.

Ensure ongoing plan for monitoring, triaging, and applying updates or configuration changes.

#### Example Attack Scenarios:

Components running with application privileges can result in serious impact from flaws.

Example vulnerabilities include CVE-2017-5638, a Struts 2 remote code execution flaw, and unpatched IoT devices.
 
Automated tools like Shodan IoT search engine can exploit unpatched or misconfigured systems, such as Heartbleed vulnerability.

## A03:2021 – Injection

Injection vulnerability ranks third.
94% of applications tested for injection with an average incidence rate of 3% and 274k occurrences.
Notable CWEs include CWE-79: Cross-site Scripting, CWE-89: SQL Injection, and CWE-73: External Control of File Name or Path.

#### Description of Vulnerabilities:

Vulnerable if user-supplied data is not validated or sanitized.

Vulnerabilities arise from dynamic queries without parameterization.

Use of hostile data in ORM search parameters can extract sensitive records.

Common injection types include SQL, NoSQL, OS command, ORM, LDAP, and EL/OGNL injection.

Source code review recommended for vulnerability detection.

Automated testing of input parameters strongly encouraged.

#### How to Prevent:

Keep data separate from commands and queries.

Prefer safe APIs or parameterized interfaces over direct interpreter use.

Implement positive server-side input validation.

Escape special characters in residual dynamic queries.

Use SQL controls like LIMIT to prevent mass disclosure.

#### Example Attack Scenarios:

Attacker modifies parameters to execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially altering or accessing sensitive data.

Blind trust in frameworks may lead to vulnerable queries, allowing attackers to execute arbitrary code.

Exploits can manipulate queries to return unintended data or invoke malicious procedures.
